                            <h3>Go 4 A Walk</h3>

                            <p>This game is a game that 2 friends and I are working on. It is a mobile app that I have made playable(ish) on computers. You may have to zoom out to see the entire screen.
                            <br>
                            The goal of this application is to make people go and walk more by making walks earn them experience and gold. On the first screen (the "town") click on the board with papers on it to be brought to "bounties" which are walks you can do for gold and experience. They only require you to walk a certain distance in a certain amount of time. By accepting one of these bounties you can go on a quest, or you can click the "forest" sign and go to the same "walking" screen. The "forest" also for unlimited walking and fighting. The GPS only works on phones so on a computer you just have to click the "step" button in order to move 1 meter (I cannot stress enough that this is for a mobile and it is very boring on a computer). Once you've taken a few steps you get a "random encounter" which you can click on and start fighting a gnome. You can tap to do damage and swipe to do critical hits. The more you tap, the higher the critical, but also the higher the chance of losing all of your critical. The box in the upper left is your journal and will tell you your current quest and you gps stats (on a computer it just says GPS disabled). On the walking screen click on the tavern to go back to the town.

                            <p>A friend and I developed this game while playing lots of <a href="http://minecraft.net" target="_blank">Minecraft</a> and <a href="http://terraria.org" target="_blank">Terraria</a>. We had high hopes and dreams, but the scope was too large and we gave up after putting a decent amount of work into it.

                            <br><br>
                            <p>This game is randomly generated (but it only uses 1 seed, so you see the same world over and over). You can walk as far as you want left or right, dig along the way (not too deep, you'll fall and eventually die of boredom), and save up all your stuff in the inventory! WASD to move, space to jump, click to dig, and esc to expand the inventory. You can also press space when infront of the building to try and build a weapon (caution: it doesn't work well and you may throw your weapon instead of attack with it. It still works, you just look silly).

                            <p>A circuit board simulator I made by myself because my class did not have enough circuit boards and my professor was thinking a program for using circuit boards may be beneficial. I also wanted to see how difficult it is to make a circuit board simulator and, as it turns out, it is incredibly difficult; therefore, it is quite buggy. The datasheets some of the the gates used in the simulator can be found <a href="Projects/CircuitSim/chipset.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. All the gates are based on the DM7400 chip set, they all just have different logic.

                            <p>This was a website that a group of myself and 3 others created for a software architecture class (SENG 299). I created all of the UML diagrams for the project, and also created the network play (client side and server side). We used MongoDB as a database and Nodejs for backend code. 
                            <br>
                            This application essentially lets the user play Go. The top 3 numbers are board sizes (9 by 9, 13 by 13, 19 by 19), then the next set of buttons allow you to choose hotseat play (no server needed), online play, or against an AI, respectively.  A few of the AI's won't work because they were available for the project but are no longer available. <br>
